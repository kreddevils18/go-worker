### Product Context: `asyncjob` Package

#### Problem

Managing concurrent background tasks in Go applications can be complex. Developers often have to manually implement solutions for:

- Safely managing a pool of goroutines (workers).
- Controlling the level of concurrency to prevent system overload.
- Passing data to jobs in a type-safe manner.
- Ensuring graceful shutdown of workers without losing active jobs.
- Handling errors from jobs.

This often leads to boilerplate, hard-to-maintain, and error-prone code.

#### Solution

The `asyncjob` package solves these problems by providing a high-level abstraction for a worker pool.

- **Developer Experience:** The primary user is a Go developer. The package is designed to be highly intuitive and easy to use. A developer can integrate background processing by simply implementing a `Job` interface and using a `Dispatcher`.
- **Core Functionality:** It allows submitting jobs with specific data payloads, processes them concurrently, and manages the entire lifecycle of the workers.
- **Future Vision:** The package is designed to be extensible. Future enhancements under consideration include:
  - Jobs that can return results (Futures/Promises).
  - Automatic job retries with backoff strategies.
  - Observability through metrics and logging.
  - Support for job prioritization.
  - Persistence layer to survive application restarts.
