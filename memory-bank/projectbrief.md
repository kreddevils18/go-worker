### Project Brief: `asyncjob` Go Package

This project is to create a reusable, robust, and type-safe Go package named `asyncjob` for processing jobs asynchronously.

The core goal is to provide a clean and idiomatic Go solution for managing background tasks, leveraging modern Go features like generics. It's designed for developers who need a reliable worker pool implementation that is easy to integrate, configure, and extend in any Go application.
